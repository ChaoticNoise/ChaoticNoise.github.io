        Chaotic Noise Marching Corps is a Seattle based renegade marching band that is dedicated to keeping the tradition of music, performance, energy, havok, discipline and sheer stupid fun alive in Seattleâ€™s streets.
        <p>
            Founded by committee members and participants of HONK! Fest West as well as other Seattle groups such as Titanium Sporkestra, and Sounders FC Soundwave Band, Chaotic Noise looks to produce high energy shows using a wide variety of musical genres.
        </p>
        <p>
            Heavily influenced by past projects as well as the likes of The Infernal Noise Brigade, Extra Action Marching Band, and HONK Bands from around the world, Chaotic Noise assures that you will have lots of fun forgetting how to think, breathe and act in
            your everyday lives.

        <p>
          Bussy, aka Black Bussy, aka Murder Bus, aka the Motherfucking bus - died on the road during our 2016 Smash the Quiet Tour, attempting to bring the Noise that is Chaotic to the West Coast. Currently, it is stranded in Medford, OR awaiting a new engine.
        </p>
        <p>
          Chaotic Noise Marching Corps (CNMC) will spend the entirety of our reserves which is a little less than half the cost to repair Bussy. The total cost requires that we raise a demonic sum of $6,660 from friends and supporters to cover the cost for a new engine and other minor work. This will enable CNMC to spread music and art to the cities and streets of the Northwest and beyond.
        </p>
        <p>
          We need raise as much of the $6,660 as possible. Backup plans include accepting more paying gigs and committing funds from all existing gigs toward this effort. Although we do not intend to continuously raise funds in this manner, this method (crowdfunding) is perfect for one time, specific capital (equipment needs) that would be otherwise too expensive for us to fund easily by normal means. This effort allows our fans to invest in us and our ability to play outside the city of Seattle and to be part of the fabric of our history and cause. It is a genuine ask of support from all those who appreciate what we bring to the community of music lovers and mayhem makers in our time of need.
